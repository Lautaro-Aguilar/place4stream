# Place4Stream

I'm Lautaro Aguilar, a passionate Full Stack developer, and I'm thrilled to introduce you to one of my standout projects: a live streaming platform developed with Next.js 14.

I created a web application for live streaming, completely free and responsive. It was built using the React Next.js 14 framework, employing Tailwind alongside Radix and ShadCN for an optimized and functional user interface.

This project provides streamers with a comprehensive set of tools, from advanced chat features to the ability to customize the viewer experience. With functionalities like user blocking, live cover editing, and real-time biography updates, it delivers an immersive and dynamic streaming experience.
